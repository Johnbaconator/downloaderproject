Congrats on reading the readme, you are indeed a rare kind of person.

If you download to windows defult download folder:Replace username with your username on computer
Run the program using the comand java -jar C:\Users\"username"\Downloads\projectdownload.jar

Otherwise use the comand: replace filepath with the path to the directory that contains the file 
java -jar "Filepath"\projectdownload.jar

When the program runs it will ask for a url to download from
The program can download individual files expect for images, still trying to figureo out why it only half loads them.
The program can download webpages however they loose thier formating, all the elements of the page are still usable assuming you have an internet conection.
The program will ask you for a name and place to save, include the path to the location you want to save to then the name, the desired file extention will have to be added here, 
or you will have to rename the file later to add it.
Example
D:\downloaded\saved\newsave.jar

The program will throw errors if it encounters a probem and tell you what phase of the opertation it encountered the error and the specific error it encountered.
When this happens the program will continue till it completes operations and the file at the end will be 0 bytes.
